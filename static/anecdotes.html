          Anecdote 1: Business Boundaries
        </p>
        <p style="color:red;">
          Dear Shifu,
          <br><br>
          I own an essay writing business, where I write essays for students at
          a 300 Yuan/100 words rate. There is a problem that I cannot be clear
          about how to solve it. And I need your guidance.
          <br><br>
          In my business, sometimes certain customer asks me to write an essay
          for their college applications. After receiving the payment, I write
          the essay and send it to him. Then he asks if I have time to help him
          edit another essay he wrote on his own. By edit, it means correct
          spelling and grammar errors, maybe even content editing, for free.
          <br><br>
          This is when I feel confused about how to deal with this situation.
          On one hand, I don’t think I should provide free editing service,
          because the money they have paid only covers the essay I’ve written
          for them, and I do provide a paid editing service (100 Yuan/100 words)
          too. On the other hand, this is an old customer who has used my
          service several times, so I don’t want to lose the potential future
          business either.
          <br><br>
          I see that I have two options here: first, tell him “No, I don’t have
          time to edit it for free. You can used our paid editing service.”;
          Second, I highlight the errors in his essay without correcting them,
          and tell him “ I can check the errors for free because you are an old
          customer. If you need serious correcting and editing, please choose
          our paid service”.
          <br><br>
          Emotionally, I feel more comfortable with the second option, and I’m
          more used to it. I am more insecure about choosing the first option,
          so I cannot objectively see the its value to my business and my
          personal life.  I’m not sure how to choose the right option if my
          goal is to build a healthy business that can support me to be healthy.
          <br><br>
          My goal for asking your advice is to be clear about how to make this
          type of decisions, so that I’m being truly responsible for my time
          and my life.
          <br><br>
          Thank you for your time. I would really appreciate your help.
          <br><br>
          Best,<br>
          Client

          Dear Client,
          <br><br>
          The answer you are looking for all depends on what is your priority:
          <br><br>
          &emsp;&emsp;+ Do you want this customer’s service?<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;+ Do you want to have clear boundaries<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;with your customers?<br>
          <br>
          You already have your answer, because if you really just wanted this
          customer’s service you would have accepted their clear disrespect of
          your boundaries.
          <br><br>
          Yes, when I say disrespect I mean they are disrespecting you.
          <br><br>
          They know you are a business (which is proved by their repeated use
          of your business) and they know what is the boundary here:
          <br><br>
          &emsp;&emsp;+ They must pay for your business
          <br><br>
          Now they want something for free. That is fundamentally a
          boundaries issues, and you don’t like it.
          <br><br>
          You need to take the time (about 1 - 2 hours a day) to sort out the
          following:
          <br><br>
          &emsp;&emsp;+ What am I so afraid of losing?<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;+ Am I willing to let my business be<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;disrespected to “keep this customer<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;happy?”<br>
          <br>
          Only self-understanding, born from time spent in meditation, can
          clarify this decision for you.
          <br><br>
          Best regards,<br>
          Shifu
