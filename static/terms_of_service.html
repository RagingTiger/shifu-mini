        <a id="subsec-title">Welcome to Shifu Life Consultants</a>
        <br>
        Thank you for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services
        are provided by Shifu Life Consultants. By using our Services, you are
        agreeing to these terms. You must follow any policies made available to
        you within the Services. Please read them carefully.
        <br><br>
        <a id="subsec-title">Who May Use the Services</a>
        <br>
        You may use the Services only if you agree to form a binding contract with
        Shifu Life Consultants and are not a person barred from receiving services
        under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. In any case, you must be at
        least 18 years old to use the Services. If you are accepting these Terms
        and using the Services on behalf of another person, a company,
        organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant
        that you are authorized to do so.
        <br><br>
        <a id="subsec-title">Using our Services</a>
        <br>
        Do not misuse our Services. For example, do not interfere with our
        Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and
        the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as
        permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws
        and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if
        you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating
        suspected misconduct.
        <br><br>
        Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual
        property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use
        content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or
        are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to
        use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure, or
        alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.
        <br><br>
        Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such
        Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic
        or safety laws.
        <br><br>
        <a id="subsec-title">Privacy</a>
        <br>
        The Shifu Life Consultants
        <a id="hili" href="privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>
        explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when
        you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Shifu Life
        Consultants can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.
        <br><br>
        <a id="subsec-title">Information on the Services</a>
        <br>
        You are responsible for your use of the Services and for any Information
        you provide, including compliance with applicable laws, rules, and
        regulations. You should only provide Information that you are comfortable
        to include in your applications.
        <br><br>
        <a id="subsec-title">Modifying and Terminating our Services</a>
        <br>
        We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or
        remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service
        altogether.
        <br><br>
        You can stop using our Services at any time. Shifu Life Consultants may
        also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our
        Services at any time.
        <br><br>
        <a id="subsec-title">Liability for our Services</a>
        <br>
        When permitted by law, Shifu Life Consultants will not be responsible for
        lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses, college or
        graduate-school admission losses or indirect, special, consequential,
        exemplary, or punitive damages.
        <br><br>
        To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Shifu Life
        Consultants, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied
        warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services
        (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).
        <br><br>
        In all cases, Shifu Life Consultants will not be liable for any loss or
        damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.
        <br><br>
        We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a
        consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then
        nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal
        rights which may not be waived by contract.
        <br><br>
        <a id="subsec-title">About these Terms</a>
        <br>
        We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service
        to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services.
        You should look at the terms regularly. Changes will not apply
        retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days
        after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a
        Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.
        If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should
        discontinue your use of that Service.
        <br><br>
        If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the
        additional terms will control for that conflict.
        <br><br>
        These terms control the relationship between Shifu Life Consultants and
        you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
        <br><br>
        If you do not comply with these terms, and we do not take action right
        away, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may
        have (such as taking action in the future).
        <br><br>
        If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not
        affect any other terms.
