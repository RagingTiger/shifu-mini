        <a id="subsec-title">Introduction<a>
        <br>
        This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, and use your
        information across our website. When using any of our Services you
        consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and use of your
        information as described in this Privacy Policy. This includes any
        information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under
        applicable law.
        <br><br>
        When this policy mentions “we” or “us,” it refers to the controller of
        your information under this policy. Despite this, you alone control and
        are responsible for the information you submit through the assessment,
        as provided in the Terms of Service.
        <br><br>

        <a id="subsec-title">Using Our Services<a>
        <br>
        We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact
        with our Services, even if you do not submit an assessment (“Log Data”).
        This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type, operating
        system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile
        carrier, device information (including device and application IDs),
        search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you
        click on, view or interact with links on our Services. We use Log Data
        to make inferences, like what Services you may be interested in, and may
        also use Log Data in the research and development ("R&D") of both academic and
        business applications related to or separate from Shifu Life
        Consultants. Information submitted through the
        <a id="hili" href="assessment.html">assessment</a>
        ("Assessment Data"), received through email correspondence
        ("Email Data"), or received through SMS text ("SMS Data") will also be
        subject to the same R&D uses for academic and business applications
        related to or separate from Shifu Life Consultants. We keep Log Data,
        Assessment Data, Email Data, and SMS Data as needed for the purposes
        described in this Privacy Policy.

        <a id="subsec">Information Sharing and Disclosure</a>
        <br><br>
        <a id="subsec-title">Law and Harm<a>
        <br>
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
        in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information
        if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law,
        regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the
        safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues;
        or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing
        in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or
        objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a
        government’s, request to disclose your information.
        <br><br>
        <a id="subsec-title">Changes to this Policy<a>
        <br>
        We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current
        version of the policy will govern our use of your information. By
        continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become
        effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
