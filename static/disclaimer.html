        <span style="color:red;">
        For Educational and Informational Purposes Only.
        </span> The information
        provided in or through our Website, Programs, Products and Services is
        for educational and informational purposes only, and is made available
        to you as self-guidance tools for your own use. When serving as a Life

        otherwise in a variety of settings, including but not limited
        to, consultations, website content, blog, Programs, Products or

        exclusively as a Consultant and in no other role.
        <br><br>
        <span style="color:red;">
        Not Medical, Mental Health, or Religious Advice.
        </span>  The information
        provided in or through our Website, Programs, Products and Services is
        not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice,
        diagnosis or treatment that can be provided by your own Medical Provider
        (including doctor/physician, nurse, physician’s assistant, or any other
        health professional), Mental Health Provider (including psychiatrist,
        psychologist, therapist, counselor, or social worker), or member of the

        medications without speaking to your own Medical Provider or Mental
        Health Provider. If you have or suspect that you have a medical or
        mental health problem, contact your own Medical Provider or Mental
        Health Provider promptly.
        <br><br>
        <span style="color:red;">
        Not Legal or Financial Advice.
        </span> The information contained in our Website, Programs or Services
        is not intended to be a substitute for legal or financial advice that
        can be provided by your own attorney, accountant, and/or financial
        advisor. Although care has been taken in preparing the information
        provided to you, we cannot be held responsible for any errors or
        omissions, and we accept no liability whatsoever for any loss or damage
        howsoever arising. The law varies by state, and it is constantly
        changing, and therefore it affects each individual and business in
        different ways.  As a result, it is recommended to seek outside
        financial and/or legal counsel relating to your specific circumstances
        as needed. You are hereby advised to consult with your tax consultant,
        accountant or lawyer for any and all questions and concerns you have,
        may have, or hereafter have regarding your own income and taxes, and
        any and all information presented by our Website, Programs or
        Services pertaining to your specific financial and/or legal situation.
        <br><br>
        <span style="color:red;">
        Not Holding Self Out.
      </span>  In my capacity as a Consultant, I serve as a
        coach, mentor, and guide that shares tools and
        support for accomplishing your life goals. I am not
        holding myself out as anything else.
        <br><br>
        <span style="color:red;">
        Personal Responsibility.
        </span> Our Website, Programs, Products, and Services aim to accurately
        represent the information provided. You are acknowledging that you are
        participating voluntarily in using our Website, Programs, Products, and
        Services, and you alone are 100 percent solely and personally
        responsible for your results. You agree to use your own due diligence
        and judgment before applying any recommendation or advice that you may
        receive on or through our Website, Programs, Products and Services.
        You acknowledge that you take full responsibility for your health, life
        and well-being, as well as the health, lives and well-being of your
        family and children (where applicable), for all decisions now and in the
        future.
        <br><br>
        <span style="color:red;">
        No Guarantees of Any Kind.
        </span> My role is to support and assist you in reaching your goals, but
        your success depends primarily on your own effort, motivation,
        commitment and follow-through. I cannot and do not guarantee that you
        will attain a particular result.
        You accept and understand that results differ by each individual. Each
        individual’s results depend on his or her background,
        dedication, desire, motivation, and a whole list of other additional
        factors.  As with any consulting program or service that you
        purchase, your results may vary and will be based on many variables.
        Therefore, no guarantees can be made. Any examples shown through our
        Website, Programs, Products and Services
        are only estimates of what might be possible for you. There can be no
        assurance as to any particular outcome based on the use of our
        Website, Programs, Products or Services. You agree that we are not
        responsible for your results stemming from the information
        presented to you through our Website, Programs, Products and Services.
        You are solely responsible for your results.
        <br><br>
        <span style="color:red;">
        Testimonials.
        </span> I present real world experiences, testimonials, and insights
        about other people’s experiences for purposes of illustration only.
        The testimonials, examples, and photos used are of actual clients and
        results they personally achieved or they are comments from individuals
        who can speak to my character and/or the quality of my work. Each
        client or individual has approved these testimonials, examples, and
        photos for use in materials to speak to my Programs, Products and/or
        Services, but they are not intended to represent or guarantee that
        current or future clients will achieve the same or similar results.
        Rather, these client stories represent what is possible with my
        Programs, Products and/or Services. Each of these unique stories, and
        any and all results reported in these stories by my clients on this
        Website and through my Programs, Products and Services, are the
        culmination of numerous variables, some of which I cannot control.
        <br><br>
        <span style="color:red;">

        non-use, of any information provided by me through any means
        whatsoever. Your use, or non-use, of this information is at your own
        risk, and you absolve me of any liability or loss that you, your

        Affiliates.
        </span>
        From time to time, I may promote or partner as an affiliate with other

        that there may be instances when I promote or market for my partners
        and in exchange I receive financial compensation in the form of
        affiliate fees and/or other rewards. Please note that I am highly
        selective as to the partners whose programs, products and/or services
        I promote and I only promote or share the programs, products and
        services of those with whom I think highly. At the same time, any
        such promotion or marketing does not serve as any form of
        endorsement. You are still required to use your own judgment when
        using or purchasing any such affiliate program, product or service to
        determine that it is appropriate for you as I waive all liability as
        related to any of my affiliates, including any of their programs,
        products or services.
